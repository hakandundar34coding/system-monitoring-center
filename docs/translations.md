# Notes For Translators:

- A translation editor (for example: Poedit) may be used for translating the ```.po``` files.

- Do not merge different information texts. For example: do not translate ```Connected - SSID``` 
as ```Connected SSID```. The text contains two different information. 

- Be careful about uppercase and lowercase letters.
